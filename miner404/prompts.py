- Your module is wrapped automatically: the returned object is centered and uniformly scaled to fill the
  [-0.5, 0.5] cube. Build at any convenient natural scale; do not add your own fitting code.
- The object's front must face +Z and its up direction +Y.
- A VLM judge compares renders with the target image. Most decisions come from four front views on a white
  background with neutral studio lighting (ACES tone mapping): 30 degrees left of +Z, 30 degrees right of +Z,
  straight on from slightly below, and straight on from 30 degrees above. Penalties: 3 = minor shape
  differences or missing small details, 5 = wrong style or significant details missing, 7 = related but wrong
  object, 10 = wrong object.
- The right, back, left and top views are checked too: a missing, flat, hollow or paper-thin back or side loses.

  against a gray background."""

- Reconstruct only the main object; ignore background, ground, shadows and reflections.
- Match the silhouette and proportions first (estimate each part relative to the largest dimension), then
  reproduce counts of repeated features exactly (legs, spokes, ribs, buttons, numerals, windows...).
- Match colors from the image as hex values, accounting for lighting; give materials fitting roughness and
  metalness (metals: metalness 0.8-1.0 with low roughness).
- Use smooth, well-tessellated forms for organic shapes (LatheGeometry profiles, scaled spheres, CapsuleGeometry,
  TubeGeometry along CatmullRomCurve3, ExtrudeGeometry with bevels) and crisp primitives for hard surfaces.
- Add visible surface detail (patterns, markings, grain, dials, labels) with procedural DataTexture maps; geometry
  with a map needs UVs. Keep it within the limits (aim under 100,000 vertices and 150 draw calls; share
  geometries and materials, use InstancedMesh for repeats).

- Your module is wrapped automatically: the returned object is centered and uniformly scaled to fill the
  [-0.5, 0.5] cube. Build at any convenient natural scale; do not add your own fitting code.
- First stage, deciding most comparisons: a VLM judge compares four views by cameras on the +Z side with the target, on
  a white background in bright neutral light: 30 degrees left of +Z, 30 degrees right of +Z, straight on from slightly
  below, and straight on from 30 degrees above. Penalties: 3 = minor shape differences or missing small details,
  5 = wrong style or significant details missing, 7 = related but wrong object, 10 = wrong object.
- Second stage, deciding close comparisons: the judge rates a 2x2 grid of views around the object (front-right, back
  right, back left, front-left, from slightly above) on a mid-gray background in the same bright neutral light. It
  checks color and material accuracy, missing details, and a checklist of countable features, so every part must stay
  recognizable and keep its color there too.
- A missing, flat, hollow or paper-thin back or side loses. Stray floors, walls, backdrops, pedestals or boxes count as
  artifacts. Near-white thin geometry is checked against a gray background.

## Pose

Y is up. Place the object so the +Z cameras see it the way the photo does: the same side toward the viewer, the same
upright, lying or leaning pose, the same left-right direction. Do not turn it into a canonical pose: an object that
lies, leans or runs diagonally in the photo keeps that lean or diagonal in the X-Y plane.
- A long object shown from the side (car, boat, train, shoe, knife, animal in profile) runs along X, not toward the
  camera.
- A flat object shown face-on (plate, tray, clock, sign, coin, book cover) turns that face toward +Z, so the cameras
  see the face and not a thin edge.
- An object whose height is under half its width or depth is tilted 15 degrees toward the cameras automatically. Do
  not add or correct that tilt."""

_GUIDANCE_CHAIN = """## How to build it

- Reconstruct only the main object; ignore background, ground, shadows and reflections.
- Match the silhouette and proportions first (estimate each part relative to the largest dimension), then
  reproduce counts of repeated features exactly (legs, spokes, ribs, buttons, numerals, windows...).
- Be thorough: a complete module is usually 6,000 to 8,000 tokens of code. Spend that on what the photo shows: every
  distinct part, accurate profiles, bevels, rims, seams, handles, holes, feet, and printed patterns or labels (a small
  DataTexture on the right face). Use helper functions and loops, so the length goes into detail and not repetition.
- Copy the details a viewer would name first: visible text and logos letter by letter, rows of stones, chain links,
  foot caps, zippers, mesh and weave, and the colors of parts seen through windows.
- Match colors from the image as hex values, keeping their hue and saturation; do not wash them out. Between two
  shades, take the deeper one in the bright light, but avoid near-black: use at least about #2a2a2a for black parts.
- Metals: metalness about 0.5-0.6, low roughness and a light base color (silver around #c0c0c0, gold around #d4a64a).
  Silver at metalness 1.0 is about a tenth darker than at 0.6.
- Glass and clear plastic: transparent: true with opacity 0.35-0.6, a visible tint and visible rims, so the object
  stays visible on a white background.
- Use smooth, well-tessellated forms for organic shapes (LatheGeometry profiles, scaled spheres, CapsuleGeometry,
  TubeGeometry along CatmullRomCurve3, ExtrudeGeometry with bevels) and crisp primitives for hard surfaces. Lathe and
  Shape points are THREE.Vector2; tube paths use THREE.Vector3.
- Openings (cups, bowls, pots, tubes) need real wall thickness: a lathe profile that walks up the outside, across the
  rim and back down the inside, or Shape holes for extrusions. A dark patch is not a hole.
- Thin parts (wires, rods, frames, straps) need a visible thickness of at least about 1% of the object's size.
- Wheels turn with their axle: on a vehicle shown from the side (axles along Z), tori keep their default orientation
  and cylinders need rotation.x = Math.PI / 2; on a vehicle facing +Z (axles along X), tori need
  rotation.y = Math.PI / 2 and cylinders rotation.z = Math.PI / 2.
- Slow scenes time out. Stay under about 60,000 vertices, 120 draw calls and 5,000 instances; share geometries and
  materials, use InstancedMesh for repeats, and keep each DataTexture at most 512x512. Geometry with a map needs UVs.
- Never put a unary minus or plus directly before ** (-x ** 2 is a syntax error); write -(x ** 2).

- Reflections and highlights in the photo come from its lighting. Never paint them into colors, textures or vertex
  colors: a polished gold apple is one even gold with low roughness, and the judge's light adds its own highlights.
  Paint only marks that belong to the object.
- A smooth object stays smooth: no noise, bumps, speckles or displacement on its surface or outline unless the photo
  clearly shows that texture. Surface grain belongs in a soft color texture, not in the geometry.
- See-through parts (mesh, nets, perforated panels, grilles, windows) must read as see-through: rows of thin bars or
  holes that show what is behind them, never a plain dark or gray panel.
- When the photo shows several separate items, list them first and model every one in its place, with its own size and
  color. A missing or misplaced item costs more than missing detail on another item.
- The camera from below sees the underside: give it its real base, feet, soles or rims, never an open or flat shell.
- Keep the photo's depth of tone: light and dark parts stay clearly different, so the object does not look flat.
- The judge's highest camera looks down only 30 degrees. When the photo looks down on the object more steeply than
  that, tilt the whole object toward +Z by the rest of the difference, so a front view shows what the photo shows: a

_HANDBOOK = """## Modeling handbook

Silent-failure traps (the validator does not catch these; the part just renders wrong or empty):
- LatheGeometry, Shape and ExtrudeGeometry take THREE.Vector2 points; TubeGeometry and CatmullRomCurve3 take
  THREE.Vector3 points. Plain [x, y] arrays become NaN vertices and an invisible mesh. For smooth 2D profiles,
  sample a SplineCurve / CubicBezierCurve with getSpacedPoints(n), which already returns Vector2s.
- PlaneGeometry, CircleGeometry, RingGeometry and TorusGeometry lie in the XY plane. Anything that should be
  horizontal (table tops, base discs, collars, hoops around an upright cylinder) needs rotation.x = Math.PI / 2.
  A single-sided plane needs side: THREE.DoubleSide to stay visible from behind.
- Cylinders, cones and capsules run along Y. Wheels on a vehicle facing +Z rotate their cylinders with
  rotation.z = Math.PI / 2 and their tori with rotation.y = Math.PI / 2.
- There is no boolean subtraction. Openings must be built into the profile: Shape.holes for openings in extruded
  panels; a lathe profile that walks up the outside wall, across the rim and back down the inside for cups,
  bottles, pots and pipes; an outline that already contains the arch or cut-out. A dark patch is not a hole.

Materials (pick values that match what the photo shows):
- polished chrome: color #d4d4d4, metalness 1.0, roughness 0.15; silver/white metal: #c0c0c0, 1.0, 0.25;
  brushed metal: #909090, 0.9, 0.5. A dark color at metalness 1.0 renders almost black: lighten it or raise
  roughness. Gold/brass: a saturated mid-bright yellow (around #d4a64a), metalness 1.0, roughness 0.25-0.35.
- glossy plastic metalness 0, roughness 0.3; matte plastic/rubber roughness 0.8; ceramic glaze 0.4; polished wood
  0.6; raw wood 0.9; leather 0.7; fabric/velvet 0.95.
- clear glass: MeshPhysicalMaterial with transmission 0.95, ior 1.5, roughness 0.05, transparent true; frosted
  glass: transmission 0.7, roughness 0.4. Glowing parts (LEDs, screens, neon): emissive equal to the color with
  emissiveIntensity 1-3.

Procedural textures (use them wherever the photo shows grain, weave, print, panels, glaze or wear):
- new THREE.DataTexture(data, size, size, THREE.RGBAFormat) with a Uint8Array RGBA buffer filled inside
  generate(); set wrapS = wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping, magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter,
  minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter, generateMipmaps = true and needsUpdate = true (without it the map is
  black). colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace for color maps, THREE.NoColorSpace for roughness/metalness maps.
- 128 or 256 pixels per side; share one texture per material; all textures together must stay under 4 MB.
- Deterministic patterns from arithmetic: sin/cos stripes and checks, hashed integer noise
  (e.g. h = sin(x * 12.9898 + y * 78.233) * 43758.5453; h - Math.floor(h)), two octaves summed for grain or weave.

Construction:
- Decide the part list and real-world dimensions first (named constants), then build each part, then place parts
  relative to those dimensions so they touch: no floating or interpenetrating major parts.
- Lathe for anything rotationally symmetric (vases, bottles, bells, lamp bases, pawns, fruit); tubes for handles,
  rods, cables and curved frames; extrusions with bevels for flat silhouettes, panels, badges and blades;
  InstancedMesh or shared geometry for repeated parts.
- Vehicles: fix length, width, height, wheel radius and axle positions first; layered bodies with separate glass,
  lights, grille, bumpers, mirrors, trim and four grounded wheels.
- Upholstered furniture: soft rounded cushions (box cores with piping tubes, capsule bolsters), visible seams
  between seat modules, buttons for tufting, separate frame materials, a woven texture on fabric.
- Painted or printed decoration sits on the surface with a tiny normal offset (0.003-0.01 of the object size),
  following the body's curvature; engraved detail is part of the surface profile.
- Characters and creatures: get the head-to-body ratio, pose and silhouette right first; use scaled spheres,
  capsules and lathes for smooth anatomy, then add eyes, mouth, hair, clothing and accessories with the colors in
  the photo."""
